I been thinking... Like... aight. One question? It's... Should I... I guess my question would be... To keep going? Or to give up? You know what I'm sayin'. That's the question. That's what I'd ask him. Should I keep going or should I just stop? That's what I'm on. Cuz life is wild as hell, man. For real. One day you out here like: "Yo Derrick! I just crushed that new crazy thing at Taco Bell." "Word? I'm just chillin", high as a  hell, watchin' cartoons." Then BOOM... next thing you know you out here buy' flowers n' shit, standing next to the homies in all black... Man... I'm not gonna lie... it's hard out here... Like... is it better to just thug it out and deal with all the bullshit life throws at me? The stress, <div class="four-credit-class">the pain, the heartbreak... </div> Or is it better to just say fuck it... quit... bounce... sleep. For good. I'm not gonna lie that sounds kinda good sometimes... But look... that's the coldest part... what if... like... what if giving up just puts us somewhere even worse? Nobody knows what comes after dyin'. We don't know what's on the other side. Ain't nobody been there and been back to tell us what's it's like. <div class="four-credit-class">Dyin' could be worse than living... </div>So it's like... we're scared to live but also scared to die... Man... <br><br><br>Life just throws one... Throws one... shit what's that word? Hold up... uhhh Vicissitude. Yeah, vicissitude! Life just be throwin' vicissitudes at your ass left and right. Scared to live and scared to die... I don't know, man... That fear of the unknown... it's got us all shook. Some days, it feels like all is lost... Even when we're hyped up, ready to scrap, boom we just get stuck. Thinkin' in circles. Paralyzed. Just frozen with fear.</div>
